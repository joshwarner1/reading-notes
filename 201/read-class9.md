In Java you have events which can change the state of an object or behavior by performing actions. Two arguments that are needed when using the addEventListener() are Key Events and Action events. Event objects keeps tracks of various events that occur on the page. The target property of events allows us to access the element of the event that was fired and its respective attributes. You also have event bubbling and capturing. Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API. When an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. Event capturing is also a method to do event propagation in the HTML DOM. In event capturing, an event propagates from the outermost element to the target element.
