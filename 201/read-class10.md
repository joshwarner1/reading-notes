In Java you can have two types of errors Syntax and Logical.Syntax errors are spelling errors in your code that cause the program not to work. Logical errors are where the syntax is correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, which leads incorrect code. In past labs I have experienced basic syntax errors like mispelling the name of a function. In the most recent labs I faced logical errors. In this situation I needed to correct my for loops which weren't put together correctly. This topic will help in my improvment with coding especially on the logic side.

In Java you have this tool called the debugger. The Javascript debuuger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints in your code. You also can pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. Breakpoint is a signal that tells the debugger to temporarily suspend execution of a program at a certain point in the code. Call stack is what program used to keep track of method calls. It is also made up of stack frames which are there for each method call.
