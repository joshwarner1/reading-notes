Having images is great for engaement for those that visit your website. The 'alt' attribute can help people get information if they use screen readers. If you want to improve accessibilty of images you can actually use the 'alt' tag.  Another element that is very useful is the 'figure' element. You can use the element to mark up a photo and you can define a caption to that photo with the 'figcaption' element along with it. We have two different images gif svg. SVG stands for scalabe vector graphics. It formats specifies images as drawing commands that can create shapes,lines,colors, and etc. It is really great for digrams, icons, and can used to draw images at any size. GIF which stands for graphics interchange format. It basically a image file that can be animated. Gif is a great tool for simple images and animations. The image type I would use for a website would be PNG. The reason why is png is great for logos which will help when building my website for my business.
