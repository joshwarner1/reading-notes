### Reading Notes 3

In HTML you are able to create multiple types of list. The best time to use a unordered list is when your creating a presentation type content for your HTML. Doing this improves the readability and applies meaning to your content.To change the bullet style of your list you can either pick a style within your CSS or you can do inline styling in your HTML code. You should use a ordered lists when you are trying to have information enumerated by the browser. Unordered list are used when the order of the items is not important. There are two ways to change the numbers in your ordered list. The first way is to place the 'start' element in between the < ol > list element. You can also use the 'reversed' element as well. You can use this element the same way as start.

Understanding the Box Model will help you create better layouts with CSS. In the Box Model you two properties called Margin and Padding. Margin is the invisible space around the box. It is able to push elements away and have positive/negative values. We can control all margins by using the 'margin' property. Margins have top, right bottom, and left. Padding is between the border and content.  It is used to push content away from the border and any background displayed will be behind the padding. Padding has it's own property just like margin which controls each side of it. It has a top, right, bottom, left. The four parts of a HTML elements box are content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. 

- Content edge- surrounds the area given by the width and height of the box. 

- Padding edge- surrounds the box padding and defines the box's padding area.

- border edge- surrounds the box's border and defines box's border box.

- margin edge- surrounds the box margin and defines box's margin.

In Java arrays store multiple valves in a single variable. Loops repeats a program until a given condition is true. The data types arrays can store are number, strings, boolean, values, and etc. The example displayed is not a valid array. You have to many brackets brackets, there is a undefined value, and the undefined value has no quotation. Java has 5 shorthand operators here is 5 of them.

- += - performs addition and assigns.
- -= - performs subtraction and assigns.
- *= - performs multiplication and assigns.
- /= - performs division and assigns.
- &= - Binary AND assigns.

In the given expression (a + c) + b; the evaultion would be (10 + false) + dog;. The reason why is that each letter equals the values. A real word example of conditional statement would be video games. The reason why is Video games use conditional statements to determine if th user wants a character to change direction. A example of when a loop is useful is logging into a webstite. If you enter a password wrong a prompt would pop up for you to enter the right password.
