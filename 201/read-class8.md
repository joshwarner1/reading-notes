In CSS the flexbox makes easier to design a responisve layout. A one-demensional layout is a layout in which you position items in rows and columns. In flkexbox you have a main and cross axis. The main axis defines how your flex items are placed in the flex. The cross axis just goes in the direction that is perpendicular to the main axis. Even though flexbox is useful it can have negativ impact on accessibilty. Flexbox is only limited to one direction which can be a disadvantage in some scenarios. Complicated flebox layout can get messy and hard to debug. 

Flexbox can be used over float and has some advantages over it as well. In flexbox you can change the order of the elements without needing to change things in the html. Positioning child elements is easier to do on flexbox. This topic has given me a better understanding of how I want a page to look and what can use to the style I want in CSS.
