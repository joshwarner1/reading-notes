Domain modeling is very important in software engineering. We need it because it is for heplful for analysis and good conceptual model for system design. It is one of the key design patterns/approaches. In HTML we should not use tables for many reasons. They require more HTML than non-table layouts which means lower slower loading and rendering. It also as increased bandwith usage. In HTML there are some semantic used in HTML table. < header > element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. The < article > element specifies independent, self-contained content. The < footer > element tag defines a footer for a document or section. It can contains things like authorship information, sitemap, contact information. 

In java constructor is used to create the instance of the class. Constructors are used to intialize the objects of the class with initial values. Constructors are invoked automatically when objects are created. Constructors can have default parameters. 'This' in object literal refers to excuting the current piece of code. It refers to the object that is executing the current function. In a constructor 'this' is a refrence to the current object whose constructor is being called. Objects can be extended and will inherit the properties and methods of their constructor.
