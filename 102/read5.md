# Design web pages with CSS

CSS is a style sheet language with the purpose of web presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. There are three ways to insert CSS into HTML documents which are inline, internal, and external. Internal you use the 'style' attribute inside HTML elements. Internal you use < style > element in the head section of your HTML. External you use < link > element to link to an external CSS file. Example: < p style="color:red;"> I want the words red. </ p>
